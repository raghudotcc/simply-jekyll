This document provides an overview for the goals and projects that are currently investigated by the IOI team consisting of Kaitlin, Richard, Q, and myself.

## Foundational research

The initial phase creates : [[Defining OI]]

## Exploring Hidden Costs of Open Infrastructure

Grant: Mellon
Duration: 15 months

Purpose: Initial exploration of the costs associated with ongoing maintenance, sustainability, and resourcing of the technology, tools, and systems that scholarship and research depend on.

### Criteria

The open in OI:

-   Projects that are not-for-profit (business form)
-   Projects that are open source (license)
-   Projects that are stakeholder governed (governance)

We are looking to investigate projects that live up to the current conventions and practices of openness in terms of business models, used licenses, and governance structures.

Desired representation in shortlisted projects:

-   Diversity in services represented (function)
-   Diversity of business models (business model)

We want to investigate a diverse group of projects that provide a variety of scholarly services and have a proven track record. Similarly, a diverse representation of business models.

Individual project requirements:

-   Influence and impact (adoption level & usage as proxies)
-   Public funding information
	-   External investment (e.g., EBSCO investment in FOLIO and OLE)
-   Affordability and accessibility by underserved audiences
	-   Potential proxies: pricing, geographic and cultural focus
-   Transformative influence; does the project shift away from dated, closed, less ideal models of scholarly communication?
-   Potential proxies: involved in OA, investment in community/policy changes

Each selected project should have a proven track record as measured by adoption levels and usage and provide access to financial documentation. Additionally, projects that address issues of inequity and injustice are of special interest.

## Arcadia Grant

Duration: 36 months

Purpose: The purpose of this grant is to *increase investment, adoption, and the sustainability* of open technology to further research and scholarship.
